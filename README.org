This R package provides an efficient C++ implementation of the [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01285][AUM]],
which can be used as a surrogate loss for 
optimizing Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) in supervised binary
classification and changepoint detection problems.

** Installation

#+begin_src R
  install.packages("aum")
  ## OR:
  if(!requireNamespace("remotes"))install.packages("remotes")
  remotes::install_github("tdhock/aum")
#+end_src

** Usage

*** Converting binary labels to aum_diffs

The code below creates an =aum_diffs= data table which represents error
functions for two labeled examples in binary classification.

#+begin_src R
  > (bin.diffs <- aum::aum_diffs_binary(c(0,1)))
     example pred fp_diff fn_diff
  1:       0    0       1       0
  2:       1    0       0      -1
#+end_src

- The first row above means there is a false positive difference of 1
  at a predicted value of 0. This is the error function for each
  example with a negative label in binary classification (no error if
  predicted value less than 0, changes up to 1 false positive for
  larger predicted values).
- The second row means there is a false negative difference of -1 at a
  predicted value of 0. This is the error function for each example
  with a positive label in binary classification (1 false negative if
  predicted value less than 0, changes down to no errors for larger
  predicted values).

*** Computing AUM from aum_diffs table and prediction vector

Next we assume predicted values of 0 for both examples, and then
compute Area Under the Minimum (AUM) of False Positives and False
Negatives and its directional derivatives.

#+begin_src R
> aum::aum(bin.diffs, c(0,0))
$aum
[1] 0

$derivative_mat
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    0    1
[2,]   -1    0
#+end_src

The result above is a named list with two elements.

- =aum= is a numeric value giving the AUM for the specified error
  functions and predicted values.
- =derivative_mat= is a matrix of directional derivatives, one row for
  each example (first column for left directional derivative, second
  column for right). In the example above we can see that decreasing
  the first prediction (entry 1,1) and/or increasing the second
  prediction (entry 2,2) results in no change to AUM. Since the right
  directional derivative of the first example is positive (entry 1,2),
  that implies an increased prediction would result in an increased
  AUM. Similarly the left directional derivative for the second
  example is negative (entry 2,1), indicating that a decreased
  prediction would result in an increased AUM.

*** Changepoint detection

See =?aum::aum_diffs_penalty= for documentation about how to compute
the AUM for supervised penalty learning in changepoint detection problems.

*** Line search

An exact line search can be computed using time which is log-linear in
the number of step sizes, see =?aum::aum_line_search= for a single
line search, and =?aum::aum_linear_model_cv= for using the line search
in each step of gradient descent when learning a linear model.
